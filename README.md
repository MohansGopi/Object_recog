You can use this for your college mini project.... 
The college students can use this source code as a example and make their own detection using open-cv and using CNN algorithm.
First you have to download the zip file file extract it and make use of it.
You can detect the object in image format and vedio vedio format and also a realtime detect using webcams.

Note:
    Inthe zip file all the image and vedios are important, becoz each image and vedio are used inside the progam, so bee carefully run it
    And before run this program in your command line make you install open-cv and numpy.
    If you are not, then paste the following commands in your promt.
             1. pip install opencv-python
             2. pip install numpy
             3. And also download a yolov3 weights file in online
    Then it will run successfully. You can modify the source code as your purpose.
